# an nginx config can have the following sections:
#
#  events: It is used to configure global event-related settings for NGINX.
#  http: It contains the main configuration for the HTTP server.
#  server: It represents a server block and defines the configuration for a specific server or virtual host.
#  location: It is used to define how NGINX should handle requests for specific URL patterns or locations.
#  upstream: It is used to define groups of servers that NGINX can proxy requests to.
